<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This repot is for people who want to see how their document will look on Medium without having to use Medium.</p>

<h2>Example use-case</h2>

<p>A writer wants to draft articles on their local disk in plain text, but wants to see how it would look on Medium before finalizing the text.</p>

<h1>Origin story</h1>

<p>From <a href="https://medium.com/@philipkd">@philipkd</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot write without the security of revision histories. When you write directly on Medium, there is always a paranoia that you'll accidentally delete what you wrote. I also like forking my documents as I explore different ideas. Plain-text provides the freedom I seek, and when paired with a good cloud backup service like Dropbox, I also have the security I need.</p>
  
  <p>However, once I transfer the text to Medium, I wind up with another revision phase, without the safeguards above. Furthermore, once I finish the document on Medium, the text there is out-of-sync with my local copy, which means that Medium is the final repository of my content. My preference is to keep plain text copies locally of everything I write.</p>
